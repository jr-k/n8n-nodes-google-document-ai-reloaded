5. Select "JSON" as the key type and click "Create"
6. Save the downloaded JSON key file securely

**Important Security Note**: Keep your service account JSON key secure and never share it publicly. In n8n, the key is stored encrypted in the credentials. When adding the credentials to n8n, you'll need to paste the entire contents of the JSON key file.
